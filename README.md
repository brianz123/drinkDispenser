# Drink Dispenser

The Drink Dispenser is an Arduino-powered project designed to automatically fill one to six cups with the drink of your choice. Built as a personal engineering challenge, this project combines hardware control, PCB design, and 3D modeling to create a functional and customizable beverage distribution system.

## Summary

This project was built for fun to explore hardware control, fluid management, and embedded systems. It uses an Arduino to control a water pump and distributes fluid into up to six glasses based on user input selected with a rotary encoder. LEDs connected to an I/O expander provide visual feedback on the number of drinks selected. The mechanical frame was designed in Autodesk Inventor, and the control board was custom-designed in KiCad.

## Features

- Dispenses to 1â€“6 cups automatically
- Rotary encoder for selecting number of drinks
- LED display (via I/O expander) to show selection in real time
- Arduino-based pump control system
- 3D-modeled and printed parts using Autodesk Inventor
- Custom PCB designed in KiCad
- Modular design for future upgrades

## Hardware

- Arduino microcontroller
- Water pump
- Tubing and splitter manifold
- Rotary encoder
- LEDs + I/O expander (for display)
- 3D-printed frame and mounts (modeled in Inventor)
- Custom PCB (designed in KiCad)

## Software

- Arduino IDE for microcontroller programming
- Rotary encoder logic to select drink quantity
- I/O expander control for LED output
- Time-controlled activation of water pump
- Open-source and adaptable for other types of liquids or expanded glass counts

## Project Goals
